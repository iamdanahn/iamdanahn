### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Daniel, a Full-Stack Software Engineer with a background in U.S. Customs Regulations and mechanics.

To break into the tech sector, I attended App Academy, where I spent 90-100+ hours a week learning a variety of languages and concepts, from JavaScript, React, Redux, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Ruby on Rails, and more. I was able to develop several projects with different stacks, reinforcing my knowledge in each language.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at Salesforce and learning their robust ecosystem!

âš¡ When I'm not coding, I'm either: working on my car, looking for something new to eat, or kicking it back with the family + an awesome dog.
